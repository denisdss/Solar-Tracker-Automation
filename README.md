# Solar-Tracker-Automation
This repository showcases an automated solar tracking system designed to optimize solar panel efficiency by dynamically adjusting their orientation to follow the sun's path throughout the day. The project combines hardware and software components to create an intelligent solar tracker that enhances energy harvesting from solar panels.
