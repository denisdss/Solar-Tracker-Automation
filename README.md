# Solar Tracker Automation

        This repository showcases an automated solar tracking system designed to optimize solar panel efficiency by dynamically adjusting their orientation to follow the sun's path throughout the day. The project combines hardware and software components to create an intelligent solar tracker that enhances energy harvesting from solar panels.

        ◉➣ Sun Tracking Algorithm: Utilizes advanced algorithms to accurately determine the sun's position based on sun position.
        ◉➣ Microcontroller Integration: Implements a microcontroller (ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, etc.) to control the movement of the solar tracker mechanism.
        ◉➣ Real-Time Data: Integrates sensors for real-time data collection, allowing precise solar panel positioning for maximum energy capture.
        ◉➣ Energy Efficiency: Maximizes energy output by ensuring solar panels are always aligned with the incident sunlight, optimizing electricity generation.
        ◉➣ User-Friendly Interface: Includes a user-friendly interface for monitoring system status, adjusting settings, and visualizing energy production statistics.
